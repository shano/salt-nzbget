salt-nzbget
===========

Salt configuration to get your box running nzbget with minimal fuss.

To configure, simply get your box up and running and fill nzbget.conf with your usenet server details.

Nzbget relevant folders currently point to /vagrant so it's using the hosts filesystem for downloading stuff, post-processing scripts etc etc.
